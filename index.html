    <h2 style="text-align: center;">POWER TO THE PEOPLE!üí™</h2>
    <p>Search a brand or product or scan a bar code to learn more about where products are from. üçÅ Get suggestions for supporting local products & brands.</p>
    <p><strong>For best results </strong> üëçüèΩ use correct spelling when entering a brand or product.</p>
    <p>‚úÖWe are using a new barcode database which we hope will improve the results.</p>
    <p> <strong> Now you can add missing barcodes</strong> using the ‚ÄòAdd Barcode‚Äô button. If necessary, when there‚Äôs no barcode or the results are unsatisfying, you can also try searching the brand name instead.
</p>
    <p>We have worked to improve the <strong>accuracy of responses</strong>, and hope you will find them useful. We are excited about A.I. and its potential! But it is still necessary to disclaim: the output of this app may not be accurate, complete, or correct. Please use this app as a starting point, & investigate further when needed! For important decisions, confirm details with other sources.</p>
    <p>Is it Canadian? üá®üá¶ You have probably already realized that this is not a simple question. It may not have a ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚Äô answer! This app responds with information about four factors:
</p>
    <p>‚Ä¢ Company ownership
</p>
    <p>‚Ä¢ Manufacturing location
</p>
    <p>‚Ä¢ Canadian employment
</p>
    <p>‚Ä¢ Source of materials. 
</p>
    <p>Some or all of these may be Canadian, or not. This information is provided to help you decide for yourself if the product meets your requirements.</p>
    <p>We hope this app helps you, and we continue to work on improvements. We are grateful for the feedback so many of you have provided. We thank you for your patience, understanding, and support as we work to improve the app!
